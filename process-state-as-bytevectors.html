  <h1>SRFI nnn: Process state as bytevectors</h1>
  <h2>Author</h2>
  <p>Lassi Kortela</p>
  <h2>Status</h2>
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>SRFI 98 and 193 give high-level access to environment
  variables and the command line, respectively. This SRFI gives
  byte-level access to that information as well as the current
  directory and the executable filename.</p>
  <h2>Table of contents</h2>
  <h2>Rationale</h2>
  <h2>Specification</h2>
  <h3>Error handling</h3>
  <p>The procedures in this SRFI raise exceptions on error. OS
  errors are represented as SRFI 198 <em>foreign error</em>
  objects.</p>
  <h3>Null terminators</h3>
  <p>Many OS interfaces are based on the C programming language
  convention of null terminators. In particular,</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A <code>char*</code> or <code>wchar_t*</code> string is
    terminated by a null character.</li>
    <li>A <code>char**</code> or <code>wchar_t**</code> string list
    is terminated by a null pointer.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Scheme knows the boundaries of each list, vector and string at
  the language level. Hence there is no need to carry the null
  terminators from C into Scheme. All procedures in this SRFI omit
  null terminators.</p>
  <h3>Current directory</h3>
  <p>(<strong>os-current-directory-as-bytevector</strong>) ⇒
  <em>bytevector</em></p>
  <p>Returns the current working directory of ths OS process as a
  bytevector.</p>
  <p>This is different from the thread-local current directory that
  some Scheme implementations have.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>On Unix, use <code>getcwd()</code>.</li>
    <li>On Windows NT, use
    <code>GetCurrentDirectoryW()</code>.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Environment variables</h3>
  <p>(<strong>os-environment-variable-as-bytevector</strong>
  <em>bytevector</em>) ⇒ <em>bytevector?</em></p>
  <p>Returns the current value of the given environment variable as
  a bytevector.</p>
  <p>The <em>bytevector</em> argument gives the name of the
  environment variable as a bytevector.</p>
  <p>If the variable is undefined, <code>#f</code> is returned. If
  the OS cannot distinguish between an undefined variable and a
  variable defined with a zero-length value, both cases return
  <code>#f</code>. If the distinction can be made, a zero-length
  value returns a zero-length bytevector.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>On Unix, use <code>getenv()</code>.</li>
    <li>On Windows NT, use
    <code>GetEnvironmentVariableW()</code>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>(<strong>os-environment-variables-as-bytevectors</strong>) ⇒
  <em>list of (bytevector . bytevector) pairs</em></p>
  <p>Returns an association list of all environment variables
  currently accessible.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>On Unix, declare <code>extern char **environ;</code> and
    use it. Each null-terminated string in <code>environ</code> is
    one environment variable in <code>"name=value"</code> format.
    The name cannot contain an ASCII equals sign; the value may
    contain any number of them. If there is no equals sign, use the
    entire string as the name and give <code>#f</code> for the
    value. Do not cache the value of <code>environ</code>: C code
    can use <code>environ = calloc(...)</code> to re-establish the
    environment variable vector at a new location.</li>
    <li>On Windows NT, use
    <code>GetEnvironmentStringsW()</code>.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Command line</h3>
  <p>(<strong>os-command-line-as-bytevector</strong>) ⇒
  <em>bytevector?</em></p>
  <p>Returns the unabridged OS command line as one string. The
  string is represented as a bytevector.</p>
  <p>This should return <code>#f</code> unless the OS native
  command line encoding is one string. It should not manually quote
  command line arguments and join them into a command line.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>On Unix, simply return <code>#f</code>.</li>
    <li>On Windows NT, use <code>GetCommandLineW()</code>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>(<strong>os-command-line-as-bytevectors</strong>) ⇒ <em>list
  of bytevectors</em></p>
  <p>Returns the unabridged OS command line as a list of
  bytevectors, with one bytevector per command line argument. The
  zeroth argument (conventionally the program name) is
  included.</p>
  <p>If the OS natively stores the entire command line as a single
  string, the result should be that string as parsed and split
  according to the canonical parsing algorithm for that OS. Note
  that this algorithm may be subtly different from the parsing
  rules used by popular command interpreters (shells).</p>
  <ul>
    <li>On Unix, use the <code>argv</code> argument passed to the C
    <code>main()</code> function. Check whether the zeroth argument
    <code>argv[0]</code> is <code>NULL</code>; if so, represent it
    as a zero-length bytevector in Scheme and look for more
    arguments starting from <code>argv[1]</code>.</li>
    <li>On Windows NT, use <code>CommandLineToArgvW()</code> to
    split the string from <code>GetCommandLineW()</code>.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Executable file</h3>
  <p>(<strong>os-executable-file-as-bytevector</strong>) ⇒
  <em>bytevector?</em></p>
  <p>Returns a pathname pointing to the executable file running the
  Scheme program. If the Scheme program is running as a standalone
  executable, this returns the filename of that executable.
  Otherwise this returns the filename of the executable housing the
  Scheme implementation. If the Scheme implementation is hosted on
  top of a virtual machine such as the JVM or the CLR, the
  executable filename will probably point to that virtual
  machine.</p>
  <p><code>#f</code> is returned if no pathname can be retrieved.
  Some operating systems do not give the information at all. Hence
  a <code>#f</code> return value is not extraordinary, and portable
  Scheme code calling this procedure should be prepared to handle
  it.</p>
  <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> This problem presents a
  particularly compelling set of almost-working solutions to lure
  implementors onto the rocks. At the time of writing there is no
  correct approach that is even moderately portable. Please be
  skeptical of any claim that a portable and correct approach
  exists.</p>
  <p>In particular, all of the following approaches are
  incorrect.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Using the current directory (AKA the working directory) is
    liable to break all the time. Programs other than simple
    scripts for personal use are rarely started from the directory
    in which they live; starting programs from arbitrary
    directories using either <code>PATH</code> lookup or an
    absolute or relative pathname is common.</li>
    <li>No <code>argv[0]</code> based approach works properly.
    <code>argv[0]</code> is simply an arbitrary string passed to
    <code>execve()</code> in its <em>argv</em> argument. By
    convention it is the program name. But contrary to popular
    belief there is no mechanism enforcing that convention.
    Multi-call binaries such as <code>busybox</code> deliberately
    take advantage of this lack of enforcement - the same
    executable can be started with any number of different
    names.</li>
    <li>Note that <code>execve()</code> takes separate
    <em>path</em> and <em>argv</em> arguments. Only <em>path</em>
    is checked to see that it points to a real file. Lamentably,
    there is no portable API to retrieve <em>path</em> from within
    the child process. Only <em>argv</em> retrieval is
    portable.</li>
    <li>When a process is started using its command name, with no
    directory part, directories in <code>PATH</code> are traversed
    to find a matching executable. Some programs try to find their
    own executable by replicating a <code>PATH</code> search for
    <code>argv[0]</code> when <code>argv[0]</code> does not contain
    a directory part. This does not work for two reasons: it’s
    trivial to pass a fake <code>argv[0]</code>, and even with a
    truthful <code>argv[0]</code> the parent process may not have
    used the same search path that it gave to the child
    process.</li>
    <li>Opening a candidate executable to compute a checksum of its
    bytes and find out whether it is the same as the current
    executable, presents a chicken-and-egg problem: where do you
    get the checksum for the current executable to verify against?
    It is also possible to install multiple copies of the same
    executable at different locations, in which case their
    checksums would match but not their filenames.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following is a partial list of correct approaches at the
  time of writing.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Darwin (macOS, iOS):
    <code>_NSGetExecutablePath()</code></li>
    <li>FreeBSD, DragonFly BSD: <code>sysctl({ CTL_KERN, KERN_PROC,
    KERN_PROC_PATHNAME, -1 })</code></li>
    <li>Linux: <code>readlink("/proc/self/exe")</code></li>
    <li>NetBSD: <code>sysctl({ CTL_KERN, KERN_PROC_ARGS, -1,
    KERN_PROC_PATHNAME })</code></li>
    <li>OpenBSD: pathname intentionally unavailable</li>
    <li>QNX: read (not readlink)
    <code>/proc/self/exefile</code></li>
    <li>Solaris: <code>getexecname()</code> or
    <code>readlink("/proc/self/path/a.out")</code></li>
    <li>Windows NT: <code>GetModuleFileNameW(NULL)</code></li>
    <li>Cygwin: readlink <code>/proc/self/exe</code> or read
    <code>/proc/self/exename</code></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
  <p>Eryk Sun and Daniel Colascione helped me understand how
  command lines actually work on Windows in theory and practice - a
  surprisingly complicated topic carrying much historical baggage.
  With their help, we are able to select the right API functions to
  retrieve the OS command line on that platform.</p>
  <p>Gregory Pakosz wrote the <em>whereami</em> library, an
  instructive collection of OS-specific solutions to the executable
  filename problem. Many people also left useful clues in various
  Stack Overflow questions.</p>
